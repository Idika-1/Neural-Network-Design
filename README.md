# Neural-Network-Design
This repository contains a two-layered classification neural network developed from scratch using JAX.

The objective of this mini-project was to develop a Classification Neural Network from Scratch using JAX. I achieved this through the following steps:
Step 1: Defined the Neural Network Architecture  
Step 2: Initialized Weights and Biases
Step 3: Implemented the Forward Pass
Step 4: Defined the Loss Function
Step 5: Implemented the Backpropagation Algorithm
Step 6: Updated Model Parameters (Weights and Biases) using Gradient Descent
Step 7: Implemented a Training Loop and Monitored the Loss across Subsequent Epochs
Step 8: Evaluated the Model Performance on the Training Set
Step 9: Evaluated the Model Performance on the Test Set

In addition, I developed several Basis functions as a function approximation model for features transformation before feeding the features through my neural network architecture. The Basis functions I developed are: -
-	Polynomial Basis Function
-	Gaussian Basis Function
-	Fourier Basis Function
